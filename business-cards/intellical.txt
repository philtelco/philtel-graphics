  This file contains some interesting (and useful) Payphone Administration
  'Incoming Call Request Codes', 'Phone Errors', and 'Transaction Indicators'.
  Ever wonder what that sneaky and mysterious COCOT company is up to behind
  the scenes? Are you a paranoid phreak who thinks they're trackin' your shit?
  
  Well you've guessed right, son. This document will show all the Intellicall
  Corporation payphone information. I hope you enjoy this document. Thanks!

  Phone Errors

 The following status codes are those that are specific to problems with the phone. 


 Code		Message				  	     Description

 78	  Unauthorized Entry		          Incoming call received from a phone
					          reporting unauthorized entry.

 79	  Hardware Error		          Incoming call received from a phone
					          reporting hardware error. The HW is
					          shown in the data field. If there is
					          no entry in the data field the error
					          is intermittent (i.e. phone coin jam).

 80	  Collection without clear	          Someone has collected the money without
					          clearing the running totals.

 82  	  Credit card hardware error	          Phone reports credit card reader problem.

 83	  Time out in Service Mode	          The payphone has had the service key
					          unlocked too long.

 84	  False incoming Call		          This is caused by the phone line in the
					          Modem ringing once and then stopping.

 85	  Non-Intellicall incoming call	          There is an incoming call detected by IFW,
					          but upon answer, no communications were
					          established. The call was probably not
					          placed by an Intellicall payphone.

 86	  Bad transmission for 3 incoming         3 attempts to communicate were unsuccessful.

 87	  N o IFW Response (no hybrid)		  Upon answering an incoming call, a four tone
						  herald was received but when a message was
						  sent there was no response. This sometimes
						  means that the hybrid is bad or missing.

 88	  Program RAM error			  An incoming call was received from a phone
						  which reports a bad program. An automatic
						  program download will begin if the program
						  file is available, as specified in the
						  download configuration.

 206	  Overdue billing records		  The billing records have been in the phone
						  beyond the requisite number of days specified
						  in the payphone's rate table.

 207	  Billing record area full		  The billing area cannot hold any further long
						  distance billing records. If this situation
						  occurs the payphone reverts to the AOS for
						  handling of long distance calls.

  		     INET Status Codes for Errors


  When IFW connects to a payphone and an error is present, IFW will log
  a 031 code in the Status Code field of the Trans.dbf. The Errbyte field
  will contain a number representing the error or errors that are currently
  detected in the payphone. The Errbyte field will continue to log this
  number for each command given by IFW until the error is corrected.


   Example:


 D  SERIAL  DATE	TIME	  CURTOT	 RUNTOTAL	RE	STA	  DWNLDFILE	RE	TRANS	ERRBY

 O  051234  06/27/1999	19:46:04   				02      031		00	00257	32768
 O  051234  06/27/1999	20:37:06   102.0000	 224.40		02	055		00	00257	32768
 O  051234  06/27/1999	20:37:07				02	067	  	00	00257	32768


 In the above example, when IFW connected to the payphone an error was detected and logged as 031,
 extended error (CDR full). The batch performed the commands in the group command. However, since
 the error still existed, the Errbyte field remains as 32768. The actual error can be found by
 examining the Supp.log file for a status code of 031. If you cannot find the error number in the
 Error Word Integer Table, it means it is a multiple error. You can use simple subtraction to find
 out what the multiple error is. (Usually done by an external program but can be done manually.)


 1. Find the nearest number from the table that's less than or equal to the
    error from the phone. Write down the error represented by this number.

 2. Subtract the number in the list from the error number received.

 3. Use the result of the subtraction to start over with step 1 again. For
    example, if the error number in question is 00024, the nearest number
    (less than or equal to) this error number is 16. This corresponds to
    Dime Slot Sensor Error. When you subtract 16 from 24, the result is 8.
    Code 00008 corresponds to Nickel Slot Sensor Error.
